# ds-spring-upskilling

This project was developed as part of the Spring Professional course offered by DevSuperior, available at [https://devsuperior.club](https://devsuperior.club).

## Overview

This repository contains the code and materials related to my learning journey and practical exercises within the aforementioned Spring Professional course. The goal of this project is to solidify my understanding of key Spring Framework concepts and best practices.

## Course Content Covered (Potentially)

While the specific content will evolve as I progress through the course, this project may touch upon the following topics:

* **Core Spring:** Dependency Injection, Inversion of Control, Bean Management.
* **Spring Boot:** Auto-configuration, Starter dependencies, Actuator.
* **Spring Data JPA:** Database interaction, Repositories, Entities.
* **Spring Security:** Authentication, Authorization.
* **RESTful APIs:** Building and consuming web services with Spring MVC.
* **Testing:** Unit and integration testing in a Spring environment.
* **Advanced Spring Concepts:** AOP, Transactions, etc.

## Getting Started

To explore and run this project, you will need the following prerequisites:

* **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Make sure you have a compatible JDK installed on your system.
* **Maven or Gradle:** This project is likely built using either Maven or Gradle as its build automation tool.
* **Integrated Development Environment (IDE):** An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code is recommended for development.

### Running the Application

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/brunobd7/ds-spring-upskilling.git](https://github.com/brunobd7/ds-spring-upskilling.git)
    cd ds-spring-upskilling
    ```

2.  **Build the project:**
    * **For Maven:**
        ```bash
        ./mvnw clean install
        ```
    * **For Gradle:**
        ```bash
        ./gradlew clean build
        ```

3.  **Run the application:**
    * **For Maven:**
        ```bash
        ./mvnw spring-boot:run
        ```
    * **For Gradle:**
        ```bash
        ./gradlew bootRun
        ```

The application should then be accessible (if it's a web application) at a specified port (usually `localhost:8080`). Check the application logs for details.
